# TG-Google-Reverse

This code performs reverse image searches on photos and stickers. When a user replies to a photo or sticker, the bot retrieves the image file path from Telegram, sends it to the reverse image search API, and displays the search result as text and a URL. It also handles error cases, such as when the user doesn't reply to a photo or sticker.
